	/// Generic domain specification result interface that 
	/// contains methods common for filtering the result.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// If the specification model uses lazy loading using <see cref="IQueryable<T>"/>, 
	/// this is the place where the query is translated and executed by calling for example
	/// <see cref="ToList"/> or <see cref="Single"/> methods.
	/// 
	/// The interface is very similar to IQueryable interface. It is basically
	/// the wrapper over the IQueryable if used under the hood. The main goal is to
	/// provide set of common methods used by all specifications. Other methods that
	/// normally IQueryable supports should be implemented in <see cref="ISpecification"/>
	/// interface using strong domain names of the method (e.g. joins, grouping, agregate functions).
	/// 
	/// Note it is perfectly fine if from domain perspective the specification already
	/// uses the functionality of this specification result. The specification should represents
	/// one query that can be customized using fluent interface but in general it should be
	/// strongly domain focused.
