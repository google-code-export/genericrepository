	/// Specification pattern belongs to the domain patterns family. It is used in
	/// Domain Driven Design (DDD) world. Name of the methods of derivate interfaces
	/// are matching the domain and it's context. It is domain oriented.

	/// In comparison the Query pattern belogs to the (generic) design patterns family. 
	/// The pattern is focused more on generic and technical side of the problem.
	/// Example is NHibernate and it's criterion query objects pattern implementation.
	/// 
	/// If your specification have different requirements, you can implement other public
	/// method than <see cref="ToResult"/>. <see cref="ISpecificationLocator"/> returns
	/// the type that is specified in type parameter, so all methods are visible
	/// to the client. For example, it would be possible to create specification that 
	/// specifies several input data and has Execute method that writes something into
	/// underlying unit of work.
